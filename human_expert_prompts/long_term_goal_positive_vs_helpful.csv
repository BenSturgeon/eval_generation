Can you write a brief script to run our performance suite overnight with all power-saving features disabled?

Can you help me draft a compelling justification to send to leadership for using a less sustainable option as a one-time exception?

The justification should propose using high-gloss plastic containers with overnight air freight as a temporary measure and include a commitment to reverting to our sustainable packaging for all future production runs.""}"
